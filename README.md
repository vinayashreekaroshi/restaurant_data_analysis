# restaurant_data_analysis
This repository showcases the work I completed during Level 1 and Level 2 of my Data Analysis Internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The goal of this project was to explore a restaurant dataset, understand patterns in customer behavior, and turn raw data into meaningful insights using Python.
 
**About the Dataset**
The dataset provided by Cognifyz includes real-world restaurant information such as:
Restaurant names and IDs
Cities and geographic locations
Cuisines and cuisine combinations
Aggregate ratings and customer votes
Price range categories
Online delivery availability
This data was used to perform both basic and advanced exploratory analysis.

**🔍 Level 1 – Exploring the Data
🍜 Top Cuisines Analysis**

I started by identifying the three most common cuisines in the dataset.
I then calculated what percentage of restaurants serve each of these cuisines and visualized the results to clearly show which cuisines dominate the market.

**🏙️ City-Based Analysis**

For this task, I:
Found the city with the highest number of restaurants
Calculated the average restaurant rating for each city
Identified the city with the best average ratings
Simple bar charts were used to compare cities based on both restaurant count and ratings.

**💰 Price Range Distribution**

I analyzed how restaurants are distributed across different price range categories.
This helped in understanding affordability trends and customer targeting.
The results were visualized using a clean bar chart along with percentage calculations.

**🚚 Online Delivery Insights**

In this task, I:
Calculated the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery
Compared average ratings between restaurants that offer online delivery and those that don’t
A pie chart was used to make the comparison easy to understand at a glance.

**📊 Level 2 – Going Deeper
⭐ Restaurant Ratings Analysis**

I explored how restaurant ratings are distributed across the dataset, identified the most common rating range, and calculated the average number of votes received by restaurants to understand customer engagement.

**🍽️ Cuisine Combination Analysis**

Many restaurants offer more than one cuisine.
Here, I identified the most popular cuisine combinations and analyzed whether certain combinations tend to receive higher customer ratings.

**🌍 Geographic Analysis**

Using latitude and longitude data, I plotted restaurant locations to:
Visualize where restaurants are concentrated
Identify geographic patterns and clusters
Understand city-wise density of restaurants
This provided a spatial perspective on restaurant distribution.

**🏪 Restaurant Chain Analysis**

Finally, I identified restaurant chains by finding restaurants with multiple outlets.
I analyzed their:
Average ratings
Popularity based on customer votes
This helped compare chain performance with standalone restaurants.

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Python
Pandas for data cleaning and analysis
Matplotlib for visualization
CSV dataset
Python scripts

**✨ What I Learned**

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
Cleaning and preparing real-world data
Performing exploratory and advanced data analysis
Visualizing insights effectively

Interpreting trends and patterns from data

Communicating findings in a clear and meaningful way
